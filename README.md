# Zenith Engine

<img src="./docs/zenith-logo.svg" alt="Alt text" width="200" height="200">

Zenith Engine is a game engine for simple games & apps. It is built on top of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D & [Pixi.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) for 2D.

It is my custom engine for my personal projects and as such is not meant to be a general purpose engine, however it is open source and you are free to use it for your own projects.
